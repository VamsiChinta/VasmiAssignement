I have used the Hybrid frame work in developing the script. It is written in Java on Eclipse. So, we have make sure that all the necessar Jar files are added before running the script. I have attached all Jar files in the mail.
There will be three packages in the script.
Before running the script make sure that Excel sheet file path  which is present in "MethodExtensions" class in "com.servicenow.test" package is changes according to your location. The Excel sheet which contians the test data is attached in the mail.
Also make sure that the driver locations for Chrome and IE which are present in "TestManager" class are changes according to your location.
After making these changes go to "Triggers" class present in "com.servicenow.util" package and run this class and this triggers entire flow.
Below are the test cases covered as a part of this assignement.
   i)Login in to application
   ii)Creation of branch
   iii)Creation of Staff
   iv)Search for branch
   v)Search for Staff
   vi)Edit the branch information
   vii)Edit the staff information
   viii)Pageination
   ix)View button
   x)Logout
   
   Note:
   1) Test cases iv to vii are covered in methods search_editbranch() and  search_editstaff() which are present in Triggers class.
   Pageination and View button are covered in pageination_and_View() method of trigger class.
